# ConvLab-3 Demo Project

This project demonstrates a basic setup for using ConvLab-3.

## Setup

1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install `convlab3` and its core dependencies like `torch`.
    ConvLab-3 has many components, and some might require additional installations or downloads (e.g., specific datasets or pre-trained models). Refer to the official ConvLab-3 documentation for details on the components you intend to use.

## Running the Demo

```bash
python main.py
```

The `main.py` script provides a very basic structure and guidance. You will need to:

1.  **Choose specific models** from ConvLab-3 for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialogue Management/Policy, and Natural Language Generation (NLG).
2.  **Load these models** in `main.py`.
3.  **Implement the interaction logic** to pass data between these components.

## ConvLab-3 Resources

*   **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab-3)
*   **Documentation:** Check the GitHub repository for the latest links to documentation and tutorials.

## Next Steps

*   Explore the `convlab.agent.algorithm` module for various dialogue agents.
*   Look into `convlab.nlu`, `convlab.dst`, `convlab.policy`, and `convlab.nlg` for specific components.
*   Follow the examples provided in the ConvLab-3 repository to understand how to load and use different models.

For instance, to use a specific pre-trained model, you might need to download it first. ConvLab-3 often provides utility scripts or instructions for this. Example (conceptual):

```python
# In main.py, after installing necessary components
# from convlab.nlu.svm.multiwoz import SVMNLU # Example NLU
# from convlab.policy.mle.multiwoz import MLEPolicy # Example Policy

# nlu = SVMNLU()
# policy = MLEPolicy()

# # ... then integrate into your dialogue loop
```

**Note:** The field of conversational AI and frameworks like ConvLab-3 are complex. You'll need to spend time with the official documentation and examples to build a functional conversational agent.
